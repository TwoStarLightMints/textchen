# textchen

**WARNING**: This project is still very much in its infancy. Many things are vulnerable to change, and some features are yet to be implemented. Please be patient at this time.

While there are many other text editors on the market (I wrote this one using [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)), I wanted to try my hand at making one and take on the largest project I have done thus far.

Textchen is not necessarily meant to be a drop in replacement for such text editors like helix or vim, as I named it textchen is supposed to be small (-chen is the diminutive affix in German). You can definitely edit text files (I am writing this README in textchen right now) and there will be some more to come.

Note: while I have put some work into making this program crossplatorm it has been primarily tested on linx (debian and arch).
